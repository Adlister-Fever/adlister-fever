<%--Error Messages--%>
<%--Isn't it frustrating when a site won't let you submit a form --%>
<%--but won't tell you why? Implement functionality to display --%>
<%--error messages to users if they do something wrong, for example, --%>
<%--if they try to register but their passwords don't match, --%>
<%--or if they try to create a ad without a title.--%>

<%--Consider storing error messages temporarily in the session and having a messages.jsp partial to handle this.--%>
